    `read_line` not only accepts the string we pass in, but also returns a value
    of type `Result`, an enumeration (enum). Enums in Rust contain multiple possible
    states called `variants`. `Result` specifically returns `Ok` and `Err` variants,
    representing a successful operation and the generated value or a failed operation
    and information about why it failed respectively.

    The 'Result' type has a callable `expect` method in-built. If the instance of
    Result is an `Err` value, `expect` will crash the program and siplay the message
    passed into it. If `read_line` returns an `Err`, it's likely an OS-level problem.
    But if the instance of `Result` returns an `Ok` value, `expect` will just return
    the generated value from within `Ok` and return that to be used. It's possilbe to
    not use `expect`, except a warning will be thrown at compile time.

    Just in case `read_line` fails, we introduce

    */
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line"); //

    /*
     If the `Result` returned from `read_line` is an `Ok` value, we'll run the
     `println` macro one more time, printing the value of `guess` within curly
     braces, known as placeholders.

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
